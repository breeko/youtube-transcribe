[{"speaker":"spk_1","startTime":0.04,"endTime":218.87,"text":"The following is the conversation with Scott Aaronson his second time in the podcast. He is a professor ut Austin director of the Quantum Information Center and previously a professor at M i. T. Last time we talked about quantum computing. This time we talk about competition, complexity, consciousness and theories of everything. I'm recording this intro as you may be able to tell in a very strange room, middle of the night. I'm not really sure how I got here or how I'm going to get out. But Hunter s. Thompson saying I think applies today in the last few days and actually the last couple of weeks. Yeah, life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body, but rather to skit in broadside in a cloud of smoke thoroughly used up, totally worn out and loudly proclaiming, Wow, what a ride! So I figured, whatever I'm up to here and yes, lots of wine is involved, I'm gonna have to improvise. Hence this recording. Okay.

The first one was with Stephen Wolfram when it was actually sunny out. In this case, it was raining, which is why I found a covered outdoor patio. But I learned a valuable lesson, which is that raindrops could be quite loud on the hard metal surface of, ah, patio cover. I did my best with the audio. I hope it still sounds okay to you. I'm learning always improving. In fact, Scott says, if you always win, then you're probably doing something wrong. To be honest, I get pretty upset with myself when I fail small or big. But I've learned that this feeling is priceless. It could be fuel when channeled into concrete plans of how to improve.

I'll connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman and now here's my conversation with Scott Aaronson. Let's start with the most absurd question, but I've read you write some fascinating stuff about it, so let's go there. Are we living in a simulation?"},{"speaker":"spk_0","startTime":219.44,"endTime":223.64,"text":"What difference does it make Bucks? I mean, I'm serious. What difference?"},{"speaker":"spk_1","startTime":223.65,"endTime":234.42,"text":"Because if we are living in a simulation, it raised the question. How real does something have to be in simulation for it to be sufficiently immersive for us humans?"},{"speaker":"spk_0","startTime":234.43,"endTime":243.35,"text":"But I mean, even in principle, how could we ever know if we were in one right? A perfect simulation by definition is something that's indistinguishable from the real thing."},{"speaker":"spk_1","startTime":243.34,"endTime":245.02,"text":"Well, we didn't say anything about perfect. It could be"},{"speaker":"spk_0","startTime":245.03,"endTime":277.26,"text":"No, no, that's that's right. Well, if if it was an imperfectly simulation, if we could hack it, you know, find a bug in it, then that would be one thing, right? If if this was like the Matrix and there was a way for me toe, you know, do flying kung fu moves or something by hacking the simulation. Well, then, you know, we would have to cross that bridge when we came to it, wouldn't we? E mean, at that point, you know it Zahhar to see the difference between that and just, uh, what people would ordinarily refer to as a world with miracles. You know,"},{"speaker":"spk_1","startTime":277.27,"endTime":285.88,"text":"What about from a different perspective? Thinking about the universe is computation like a program running in a computer is that's kind of a neighboring concept."},{"speaker":"spk_0","startTime":285.89,"endTime":350.31,"text":"It is. It is an interesting and reasonably well defined question to ask, Is the world computer bubble you know, does the world satisfy what we would call in CS the church touring thesis that is, You know, could we take any physical system and simulate it, Thio. You know any desired precision by a touring machine? You know, given the appropriate input data, right? And so far, I think the indications are pretty strong that our world does seem to satisfy the church Turing thesis. Uh, at least if it doesn't, then we haven't yet discovered. Why not? But now, does that mean that our universe is a simulation? Well, you know that words seems to suggest that there is some other larger universe in which it is running right. And the problem there is that if the simulation is perfect, then we're never going to be able to get any direct evidence about that other universe. You know, we will only be able to see, uh, the effects of the computation that is running in this universe."},{"speaker":"spk_1","startTime":350.32,"endTime":370.46,"text":"Well, let's imagine analogy. Let's imagine a PC, a personal computer, a computer. Is it possible with the advent of artificial intelligence for the computer to look outside of itself to see, to understand its creator e mean that Z is that"},{"speaker":"spk_0","startTime":370.47,"endTime":433.32,"text":"ridiculous? Well, well, well, I mean, with the computers that we actually have, I mean, first of all way, all know that humans have done an imperfectly job of, you know, in enforcing the abstraction boundaries of computers, right? Like you may try to confine some program to a playpen. But, you know, a soon as there's one, uh, memory allocation error in the sea program, then the program has gotten out of that play pen, and it could do whatever it wants, right? This is how most hacks work, you know, viruses and worms and X points. And, you know, you would have to imagine that in a I would be able to discover something like that. Now, you know, of course, if we could actually discover some exploit of reality itself, then you know, then this whole I mean way, then in some sense, we way wouldn't have two philosophies about this, right? This would no longer be a metaphysical conversation, right? This which is. But that's the question"},{"speaker":"spk_1","startTime":433.32,"endTime":435.16,"text":"is what is what Would that hack look like? It."},{"speaker":"spk_0","startTime":435.16,"endTime":502.55,"text":"Yeah, well, I I have no idea. I mean, uh, Peter Shore, you know, the, you know, very famous person in quantum computing, of course, has a joke. That may be the reason why we haven't yet. You know, integrated general relativity and quantum mechanics is that, you know, the part of the universe that depends on both of them. Was that what was actually left unspecified. And if we ever tried to do an experiment involving the singularity of a black hole or something like that, then you know, the universe would just generate an overflow our or something way would just crash the universe. Now, um, you know, the the universe, you know, has seemed toe hold up pretty well for, you know, 14 billion years, right? So, you know, my, uh, you know, uh, Occam's razor kind of guess has to be that, you know, it will continue to hold up. You know that the fact that we don't know the laws of physics governing some phenomenon is not a strong sign that probing that phenomenon is going to crash the universe. Right. But, you know, of course, I could be wrong,"},{"speaker":"spk_1","startTime":502.74,"endTime":550.92,"text":"but do you think on the physics side of things, you know, there's been, uh, recently a few folks Eric Weinstein and Stephen Wolfram that came out with the theory of everything. I think there's a history of physicists dreaming and working on the unification of all the laws of physics. Do you think it's possible that once we understand more physics, not necessarily the unification of the laws, but just understand physics more deeply at the fundamental level will be able to start. You know, uh, I mean, part of this is humorous, but, uh, looking to see if there's any bugs in the universe that could be exploited for, uh, you know, traveling at and not just the speed of light, but just traveling faster than our current spaceships can travel all that kind of stuff."},{"speaker":"spk_0","startTime":550.93,"endTime":612.37,"text":"Well, I mean, t to travel faster than our current spaceships could travel. You wouldn't need to find any bug in the universe, right? The known was a physics, you know, let us go much faster up to the speed of light, right? And you know, when people want to go faster than the speed of light, well, we actually know something about what that would entail. Namely that, you know, according to relativity, that seems to entail communication backwards in time. Okay, so then you have to worry about closed time like curves and all of that stuff. So, you know, in some sense, we we sort of know the price that you have to pay for these things right Way. That's right. That's right. We can't, you know, say that they're impossible. But we you know, we know that sort of a lot else in physics breaks, right? So now regarding Eric Weinstein and Stephen Wolfram like, I wouldn't say that either of them has a theory of everything. I would say that they have ideas that they hope you know, could someday lead to a theory of everything."},{"speaker":"spk_1","startTime":612.44,"endTime":613.68,"text":"Is that a worthy pursuit?"},{"speaker":"spk_0","startTime":613.69,"endTime":663.85,"text":"Well, I mean, certainly, Let's say, by theory of everything you know, we don't literally mean a theory of cats and of baseball and, you know, but we just mean it in the in the more limited sense of everything. A fun, a fundamental theory of physics, right of all of the fundamental interactions of physics. Of course, such a theory, even after we had it, uh, you know, would would leave the entire question of all the emergent behavior, right? You know, Thio to be explored. Eso It's so it's only everything for a specific definition of everything. OK, but in that sense, I would say, of course, that's worth pursuing e. I mean, that is the entire program of fundamental physics, right? All of my friends who do quantum gravity who do string theory who do anything like that, that is what's motivating them. Yeah, it's funny,"},{"speaker":"spk_1","startTime":663.85,"endTime":670.19,"text":"though. But then Eric Weinstein talks about this. It is I don't know much about the physics world, but I know about the A I world,"},{"speaker":"spk_0","startTime":670.19,"endTime":670.97,"text":"and it is"},{"speaker":"spk_1","startTime":670.97,"endTime":702.66,"text":"a It is a little bit taboo, uh, to talk about a G I, for example, on the AI side s oh, really? To talk about the big dream of the community, I would say, because it seems so far away, it's almost taboo to bring it up because, you know, it's seen as if the kind of people that dream about creating a truly super human level intelligence that's really far out there people because we're not even close to that. And it feels like the same thing is true for the physics community."},{"speaker":"spk_0","startTime":703.14,"endTime":734.74,"text":"I mean, Stephen Hawking certainly talked constantly about theory of everything right. Uh, you know, I mean, I mean people, you know, use those terms who were, You know, some of the most respected people in the in the in the whole world of physics, right? But, I mean, I think that the distinction that I would make is that people might react badly if you use the term in a way that suggests that that you, you know, thinking about it for five minutes have come up with this major new insight about it, right? It"},{"speaker":"spk_1","startTime":734.74,"endTime":761.7,"text":"za difficult. Stephen Hawking is not a great example because I think you could do whatever the heck you want. When you get to that level, I certainly see like seeing your faculty. You know, You know, at that point that's the one of the nice things about getting older. You just stopped giving a damn. But community is the whole. They tend to roll their eyes very quickly and stuff that's outside the quote unquote mainstream."},{"speaker":"spk_0","startTime":761.71,"endTime":802.88,"text":"Well, let me let me put it this way. I mean, if you ask, you know Ed Witten, let's say who is, You know, you might consider a leader of the string community, and that's, you know, very, very mainstream, in a certain sense. But he would have no hesitation in saying, You know, of course, you know, they're looking for a you know, uh, you know, a unified description of nature of, you know, of general relativity of quantum mechanics, of all the fundamental interactions of nature. Right now, you know whether people would call that a theory of everything, whether they would use that that term that might vary. You know, Lenny Susskind would definitely have no problem telling you that. You know, if that's what we want, right for me,"},{"speaker":"spk_1","startTime":802.88,"endTime":816.89,"text":"who loves human beings and psychology. It's kind of ridiculous to say, uh ah. Theory that unifies the laws of physics, gets you to understand everything. I would say you're not even close to understanding everything."},{"speaker":"spk_0","startTime":816.89,"endTime":842.6,"text":"Yeah, right. Well, yeah, I mean, the word. Everything is a little ambiguous here, right? Because, you know, and then people will get into debates about, you know, reductionism versus emergent ism and blah, blah, blah. And so, in not wanting to say theory of everything, people might just be trying to short circuit that debate and say, you know, look, you know yes, we want a fundamental theory of, you know, the particles and interactions of nature."},{"speaker":"spk_1","startTime":842.61,"endTime":853.9,"text":"Let me bring up the next topic that people don't want to mention. Although they're getting more comfortable with it is consciousness. You mentioned that you ever talk and consciousness that they watch five minutes of but the Internet connections really"},{"speaker":"spk_0","startTime":853.91,"endTime":867.02,"text":"was This might talk about, you know, ah, refuting the integrated information theory. But my particular account of consciousness that, Yeah, I think one could just show it doesn't work so much harder to say What does work? Yeah,"},{"speaker":"spk_1","startTime":867.03,"endTime":876.89,"text":"let me ask. Maybe it would be nice. Thio comment on you Talk about also, like, semi hard problem conscious or almost hard, Probably kind of hard,"},{"speaker":"spk_0","startTime":876.89,"endTime":879.17,"text":"Pretty, pretty hard, Pretty hard. Eso maybe."},{"speaker":"spk_1","startTime":879.17,"endTime":890.14,"text":"Can you talk about that? Their idea of of the approach to modeling consciousness and why you don't find it convincing. What is it? First of all, what?"},{"speaker":"spk_0","startTime":890.15,"endTime":917.36,"text":"Okay, well, so so what? What? What? I called the pretty hard problem of consciousness. This is my term. Although many other people have said something equivalent to this. Okay, uh, but it's just, you know, the the problem of, you know, giving an account of just which physical systems are conscious and which are not. Or, you know, if there are degrees of consciousness, then quantifying how conscious a given system is"},{"speaker":"spk_1","startTime":917.34,"endTime":918.93,"text":"s. So that's the pretty"},{"speaker":"spk_0","startTime":918.93,"endTime":920.46,"text":"hard that's what I mean."},{"speaker":"spk_1","startTime":920.46,"endTime":923.7,"text":"That's it. I'm adopting it. I love it. That's a good good ring to it."},{"speaker":"spk_0","startTime":923.71,"endTime":958.8,"text":"And so, you know, the infamous hard problem of consciousness is to explain how something like consciousness could arise at all. You know, in a material universe, right? Or you know, why does it ever feel like anything Thio experience anything, right? And and you know, So I'm trying to distinguish from that problem, right? And say, you know no. Okay, I am. I would merely settle for an account that could say, you know, is a fetus conscious, you know? If so, which trimester, you know, is a isa dog conscious, You know, what about ah frog or"},{"speaker":"spk_1","startTime":958.81,"endTime":963.26,"text":"even as a precondition? You take that. Both these things are conscious. Tell me which is more"},{"speaker":"spk_0","startTime":963.26,"endTime":1115.13,"text":"conscious, for example? Yes. Yeah. I mean, if consciousness to some multi dimensional vector, we'll just tell me in which respects these things are conscious and in which respect they aren't right and, you know, and have some principled way to do it where you're not, you know, carving out exceptions for things that you like or don't like. But could some how? Take a description of an arbitrary physical system and then just based on the physical properties of that system or the informational properties or how it's connected or something like that, just in principle, calculate, You know, it's degree of consciousness, right? I mean, this this, this would be the kind of thing that we would need, you know, if we wanted to address questions like, you know, what does it take for a machine to be conscious, right? Or when? Or you know, when? When when should we regard a eyes is being conscious. Um, so now this IittIe this'll integrated information theory, which has been put forward by Giulio Timoney and ah, bunch of his, uh, collaborators over the last decade or two. Uh, this is noteworthy, I guess, as a direct attempt. Thio, answer that question to, you know, answer the to address the pretty hard problem right? And they give a ah criterion that's just based on how a system is connected. So you so it's up to you to sort of abstract the system like a brain or a microchip as a collection of components that are connected to each other by some pattern of connections. You know and on and to specify how the components can influence each other. You know, like where the inputs go, you know, where they affect the outputs. But then once you've specified that, then they give this quantity that they call fee. You know, the Greek letter fee and the definition of fee has actually changed. Over time, it changes from one paper to another. But in all of the variations, it involves something about what we in computer science would call graph expansion. So basically, what this means is that they want, um, in order to get a large value of fee. Uh, it should not be possible to take your system and partition it into two components that are only weakly connected to each other. Okay, so whenever we take our system and sort of try to split it up into two, then there should be lots and lots of connections going between the two components."},{"speaker":"spk_1","startTime":1115.14,"endTime":1138.59,"text":"Okay, well, I understand what that means in a draft. Do they formalize what? How to construct such a graph for data structure, whatever, or is this one of the criticism I've heard you kind of say is that ah, lot of their very interesting specifics. Air usually communicated through like natural language like like through words. So it's like the details aren't always"},{"speaker":"spk_0","startTime":1138.59,"endTime":1177.54,"text":"well, they well, it's true. I mean, they have nothing even resembling a derivation of this fee. Okay, so what they dio is they stayed a whole bunch of postural it, you know, axioms that they think that consciousness should satisfy. And then there's just some verbal discussion and then at some point fee, appears right and this. This was the first thing that really made the hair stand on my neck. To be honest, because they are acting as if there is a derivation, they're acting as if you know you're supposed Thio. I think that this is a derivation, and there's nothing even remotely resembling a Derby. They just pull the fee out of a hat completely."},{"speaker":"spk_1","startTime":1177.54,"endTime":1181.04,"text":"Is one of the key criticisms to use the details are missing? Or that"},{"speaker":"spk_0","startTime":1181.04,"endTime":1276.36,"text":"that's that's not That's not even the key criticism. That's just that's just a side point. Okay, The core of it is that I think that they, you know, they want to say that a system is more conscious, the larger its value of fee and I think that that is obvious nonsense. Okay, as soon as you think about it for, like, a minute, A soon as you think about it, in terms of could I construct a system that had an enormous value of fee, like, you know, even larger than the brain has. But that is just implementing an error correcting code, you know, doing nothing that we would associate with, you know, intelligence or consciousness or any of it. Theano, sir, is yes, it is easy to do that right on. So I wrote Block Post just making this point that Yeah, it's easy to do that now. You know, 10 owns. Response to that was actually kind of incredible, right? I mean, I I admired it in a way, because instead of disputing any of it, he just bit the bullet in the sense, you know, he was one of the the most audacious bullet biting I've ever seen in my career. Okay, he said, Okay, then. Fine. You know this system that just applies this error correcting code, it's conscious, you know, And if it has a much larger value of fee, then you are may it's much more conscious than you know, You. We just have to accept what the theory says because, you know, science is not about confirming our intuitions. It's about challenging them. And, you know, this is what my theory predicts. That this thing is conscious and, you know, our super duper conscious. And how are you gonna prove me wrong? See how it"},{"speaker":"spk_1","startTime":1276.37,"endTime":1294.99,"text":"so The way I would argue against your block post is that would say Yes. Sure, you're right in general, but for naturally arising systems developed through the process of evolution on Earth, the this rule of the larger fee being associate being associate with more consciousness is correct. So if"},{"speaker":"spk_0","startTime":1294.99,"endTime":1299.88,"text":"it does not what he said at all, right? Right. Because he wants this to be completely general,"},{"speaker":"spk_1","startTime":1299.89,"endTime":1301.83,"text":"so we can apply to even computers."},{"speaker":"spk_0","startTime":1301.83,"endTime":1395.68,"text":"Yeah. I mean, I mean, the whole interest of the theory is the, you know, the hope that it could be completely general apply to aliens to computers thio, uh, animals, coma patients to any of it, right? And, uh, eso so So he just said, Well, you know, Scott is relying on his intuition, but, you know, I'm relying on this theory and you know, to May, it was almost like, you know, Are we being serious here? Like like like, you know, like like Okay, yes. In science, we try to learn highly non intuitive things. But what we do is we first test the theory on cases where we already know the answer, right? Like if if someone had a new theory of temperature, right then, you know, maybe we could check that It says that's boiling water is hotter than ice. And then if it says that the sun is hotter than anything you know you've ever experienced, then maybe we we trust that extrapolation, right? But like this, this theory like if if you know it's now saying that you know, a gigantic grit like regular grid of exclusive or Gates can be way more conscious than you know, a person or than than any animal can be. You know, even if it you know is, you know, is is so uniformed that it might as just well, just be a blank wall, right? And And so now the point is, if if this theory is sort of getting wrong, the question is a blank wall, you know, more conscious than a person that I would say, What is what is there for it to get right?"},{"speaker":"spk_1","startTime":1395.94,"endTime":1402.31,"text":"So your senses a blank wall, uh, is not more conscious than a human being?"},{"speaker":"spk_0","startTime":1402.31,"endTime":1420.81,"text":"Yeah, I mean, I mean I mean, you could say that I am taking that as one of my axioms. I'm saying, I'm saying that if a theory of consciousness is getting that wrong, then whatever it is talking about at that point, I I'm not going to call it consciousness. I'm going to use a different word."},{"speaker":"spk_1","startTime":1420.81,"endTime":1436.15,"text":"You have to use a different word. I mean, it's possible, just like with intelligence, that us humans conveniently define these very difficult to understand concepts in a very human centric way. That's like the Turing test really seems to define. Intelligence is a thing that's human,"},{"speaker":"spk_0","startTime":1436.15,"endTime":1462.4,"text":"like right. But I would say that with any concept, you know, there's, uh, way first need to define it right. And a definition is only a good definition if it matches what we thought we were talking about, you know, prior to having a definition right on. And I would say that you know, uh, fee as a definition of consciousness fails that test. That is my argument."},{"speaker":"spk_1","startTime":1462.41,"endTime":1470.99,"text":"So okay, s So let's take a further step.

I"},{"speaker":"spk_0","startTime":1494.34,"endTime":1519.29,"text":"don't know these air what you know have been called the vertiginous questions right? There is the questions.

But why should you believe may? Right? I mean, and if you said the same to me, then why should I believe you?"},{"speaker":"spk_1","startTime":1519.3,"endTime":1546.44,"text":"But as computer scientists, I feel like ah, computer could be intel could achieve human level intelligence. But and that's actually a feeling in the hope that's not a scientific belief, is just we've built up enough intuition the same kind of intuition you're using your blogged. You know, that's what scientists do, They I mean, some of it is a scientific method, but some of it is just damn good intuition. I don't have a good intuition of our consciousness. Yeah, I'm"},{"speaker":"spk_0","startTime":1546.44,"endTime":1553.79,"text":"not sure that anyone does or has in the, you know, 2500 years that these things have been discussed, Lex.

Can't wait to hear your opinion on this, but attending your link event and one of the dreams there is Thio, uh, you know, basically pushing your science forward. And the hope of neuroscience is that weaken Inspect the machinery from which all this fun stuff emerges and see our We're gonna notice something special, Some special sauce from which something like consciousness or cognition emerges."},{"speaker":"spk_0","startTime":1582.63,"endTime":1655.85,"text":"Yeah, well, it's clear that we've learned an enormous amount about neuroscience. We've learned an enormous amount about computation, you know, about machine learning about ai, how to get it to work. We've learned a nen or mus amount about the underpinnings of the physical world, you know, and you know it from one point of view. That's like a nen or mus distance that we've traveled along the road to understand and consciousness from another point of view. You know, the distance still to be traveled on the road, you know, maybe seems no shorter than it was at the beginning, right? So it's very hard to say I mean, you know, these air questions like like in in in sort of trying toe have a theory of consciousness. There's sort of AH, problem where it feels like it's not just that we don't know how to make progress. It's that it's hard to specify what could even count this progress right? Because no matter what scientific theory someone proposed, someone else could come along and say, Well, you've just talked about the mechanism. You haven't said anything about what breathes fire into the mechanism. What really makes there's something that it's like to be it right. And that seems like an objection that you could always raise no matter. You know how much someone elucidated the details of how the brain works."},{"speaker":"spk_1","startTime":1655.84,"endTime":1707.4,"text":"Okay, lets go Touring, testing lab surprise. I have this intuition call me crazy, but we that a machine to pass the Turing test, and it's full. Whatever the spirit of it is, we can talk about how to formulate the perfect Turing test, that that machine has to be conscious or we at least have Thio. I have a very low bar of what consciousness is a dentist. I tend to think that the emulation of consciousness is as good as consciousness. So, like consciousness is just the dance. A social, a social shortcut like a nice, useful tool. But I tend to connect intelligence, conscience together. So by by that do you maybe just thio ask What? What role does consciousness play?

So if your position is that, you know, emulation of consciousness is consciousness, then you know, by by definition, any machine that passed the Turing test would be conscious. But it's, uh But I mean, we know that you could say that, you know that that is just a way to rephrase the original question, you know, is an emulation of consciousness, you know, necessarily conscious, right?

Well, well, yeah, yeah, but but this is I mean, I mean, the Chinese room actually would be doing some computation, at least in circles. Version right here. I'm just talking about a table. Look up. Okay, Now, it's true that for conversations of a reasonable length, this, you know, look up table would be so enormous, it wouldn't even fit in the observable universe.

But once we understanding in a machinery, it stops being magic. Eso like that's a prerequisite is that you can't know how it works over some part of it.

You know, like, I don't need you to tell me that I'm conscious, right? Nor do you need made thio tell you that you are right. So eso but But basically what I explored there is, you know, are there, uh, aspects of, ah, system like like a brain that that just could not be predicted, Even with arbitrarily advanced future technologies, It's because of chaos combined with quantum mechanical uncertainty.

And then maybe you put the prediction in a sealed box and maybe, you know, you you, uh, open it later and you show that you knew everything I was going to dio or, you know, of course, the even creepier version would be You tell me the prediction and then I try to falsify and my very effort to falsify it makes it come true, right? Let's let's let's you know, let's even forget that you know that version. As convenient as it is for fiction writers, right? Let's just let's just do the version where you put the prediction into a sealed envelope. Okay, but if you could reliably predict everything that I was going to dio, I'm not sure that that would destroy my sense of being conscious But I think it really would destroy my sense of having free will, you know, and much, much more than any philosophical conversation could possibly do that, right? And so I think it becomes extremely interesting to ask, you know, could such predictions be done? You know, even in principle, is it consistent with the laws of physics to make such predictions to get enough data about someone that you could actually generate such predictions without having to kill them in the process to, you know, slice their brain up into little slivers or something politically possible, Right? Well, I don't know. I mean, I mean, it might be possible, but only at the cost of destroying the person. All right. I mean, it depends on how low you have to g o in sort of the substrate. Like if there was a nice digital abstraction layer, if you could think of each neuron as a kind of transistor computing a digital function, then you could imagine some nano robots that would go in. And we just scan the state of each transistor, you know, of each neuron, and then, you know, make a a good enough copy. Right? But if it was actually important to get down to the molecular or the atomic level, then you know, eventually you would be up against quantum effects. You would be up against the UN clone ability of quantum states. So I think it's a question of how good of a replica. How good does the replica have to be before you're going to count it as actually a copy of you or is being able to predict your actions?

And and and especially once we say that Well, look, maybe there. There's no way to predict, you know, to make a deterministic prediction because, you know, there's all you know. We know that there's noise buffeting the brain around presumably, even quantum mechanical uncertainty, you know, affecting the sodium ion channels, for example, whether they open or they close. Um, you know, there's no reason why, over a certain timescale, that shouldn't be amplified, just like we imagine happens with the weather or with any other, you know, chaotic system.

Penrose is work on consciousness saying that there, you know, there is some with Exxon's and so on. There might be some biological places where quantum mechanics can come into play and through that, create consciousness somehow."},{"speaker":"spk_0","startTime":2195.77,"endTime":2584.71,"text":"Yeah. Okay. Well, I'm familiar with his work. And of course, you know, I read Penrose is books as a teenager. They had a huge impact on May 5 or six years ago, I had the privilege to actually talk these things over with Penrose, you know, at some length at a conference in Minnesota, and you know, he is, uh, you know, an amazing personality. I admire the fact that he was even raising such audacious questions at all, but you know, to to to answer your question, I think the first thing we need Thio get clear on is that he is not merely saying that quantum mechanics is relevant to consciousness. Right? That would be like, you know, that would be tame compared to what he is saying, right? He is saying that, you know, even quantum mechanics is not good enough, right? Because if supposing, for example, that the brain were a quantum computer, maybe that's still a computer. You know, In fact, a quantum computer can be simulated by an ordinary computer. It might merely need exponentially more time in order to do so. Right? So that's simply not good enough for him. Okay, So what he wants is for the brain to be a quantum gravitational computer. Oh, our ah, He wants the brain to be exploiting as yet unknown laws of quantum gravity. Okay, which would Which would be UN computer bubble. Okay, Yes, yes, that would be literally un compute herbal. And I've asked him, you know, to clarify this but un compute a ble Even if you had an oracle for the halting problem or you know, and or, you know, as high up a Z, you want to go in this sort of high the usual hierarchy of un compute ability, he wants to go beyond all of that. Okay, so So, you know, just just to be clear, Like, you know, if if we're keeping count of how many speculations, you know, there's probably like a least five or six of them, right? There's first of all that there is some quantum gravity theory that would involve this kind of un compute ability, right? Most people who study quantum gravity would not agree with that. They would say that what we've learned. You know what little we know about quantum gravity from the 80 s CFT correspondence, for example, has been very much consistent with the broad idea of nature being computer ble. Right? Um but but but But supposing that he's right about that, then you know what most physicists would say is that whatever new phenomena there are in quantum gravity, you know, they might be relevant at the singularities of black holes. They might be relevant at the Big Bang. Uh, they are plainly not relevant to something like the brain, you know, that is operating at ordinary temperatures, you know, with ordinary chemistry. And, you know, the physics underlying the brain. They would say that we have, you know, the fundamental physics of the brain. They would say that we've pretty much completely known for for generations now, right? Because, you know, quantum field theory lets us sort of parameter rise our ignorance, right? I mean, Sean Carroll has made this case and, you know, in great detail, right? That sort of whatever new effects air coming from quantum gravity, you know, they're sort of screened off by quantum field theory. Right? And this is this bring, you know, brings us to the whole idea of effective theories, right? But like we have, you know, in like in the standard model of elementary particles, right? We have a quantum field theory that seems totally adequate for all of the terrestrial phenomena, right? The only things that it doesn't, you know, Expo playing are Well, first of all, you know the details of gravity. If you were to probe it, like at at, uh, you know, extremes of, you know, curvature, like incredibly small distances. It doesn't explain dark matter. It doesn't explain black holes singularities. Right. But these are all very exotic things very, you know, far removed from our life on earth. Right? So for Penrose to be right, he needs, you know, these phenomena to somehow affect the brain. He needs the brain to contain antenna that are sensitive. Thio this as yet unknown physics. Right? And then he needs, ah, modification of quantum mechanics. Okay, so he needs quantum mechanics toe actually be wrong. Okay. He needs what? What he wants is what he calls an objective reduction mechanism or an objective collapse. So this is the idea that once quantum states get large enough, then they somehow spontaneously collapse. Right? That, uh um you know, and and this is an idea that lots of people have explored. Uh, you know, there's something called the G R w proposal that tries Thio, You know, say something along those lines. You know, these air theories that actually make testable predictions right, which is a nice feature that they have. But you know, the very fact that they're testable may mean that in the, uh, you know, in the in the coming decades, we may well be able to test these theories and show that they're they're they're wrong, right? Uh, you know, we may be able to test some of Penrose is ideas, if not not his ideas about consciousness, but at least his ideas. That about an objective collapse of quantum states. Right? And people have actually, like Dick Ball. Mr. Have actually been working to try to do these experiments. They haven't been able to do it yet. To attest. Penrose is proposal. Okay, but Penrose would need more than just an objective collapse of quantum states, which would already be the biggest development in physics for a century since quantum mechanics itself. Okay, he would need for consciousness to somehow be able to influence the direction of the collapse so that it wouldn't be completely random, but that, you know, your dispositions would somehow influence the quantum state to collapse. More likely this way or that way. Okay. Finally. Penrose, you know, says that all of this has to be true because of an argument that he makes based on girdles. Incompleteness. The're, um Okay, Now, Blake, I would say the overwhelming majority of computer scientists and mathematicians who have thought about this. I don't think that girdles incompleteness theorem can do what he needs it to dio here, right? I don't think that that argument is sound, okay, but that is, you know, that is sort of the tower that you have to ascend to if you're going to go where Penrose goes,"},{"speaker":"spk_1","startTime":2584.71,"endTime":2592.01,"text":"and then inclusion uses with the complete the serum is that basically that there's important stuff that's not compute herbal?"},{"speaker":"spk_0","startTime":2592.1,"endTime":2788.11,"text":"Uh, it's not. It's not just that, because, I mean, everyone agrees that there are problems that a run compute a ble. Right? That's a mathematical theory. Um, right, that. But what penrose wants to say is that, uh, you know, the you know, for example, there are statements, uh, you know, for, you know, given any, uh, formal system, you know, for doing math, right? There will be true statements of arithmetic that that formal system. You know, if it's adequate for math at all, if it's consistent and so on will not be able to prove famous example being the statement that that system itself is consistent, right? No. You know, good formal system can actually prove its own consistency. That can only be done from a stronger formal system, which then can't prove its own consistency and so on forever. Okay, that's girdles. The're, um But now why is that relevant Thio consciousness, right? Uh, well, you know, I mean, I mean, the idea that it might have something to do with consciousness is an old one. Girdle himself, Apparently thought that, you know, Ah, Lucas, um, thought so. I think in the sixties, and Penrose is really just, you know, sort of updating What? What, what? What they and others had said. I mean, you know, the idea that girdle serum could have something to do with consciousness was, you know, um, in in 1950 when Alan Turing wrote his article about the Turing test, He already you know, I was writing about that as like an old and well known idea, and is one that he was a za wrong one that he wanted to dispense with. Okay, But the basic problem with this idea is you know, Penrose wants to say that and all of his predecessors, your you know want to say that. You know, even though you know this given formal system cannot prove its own consistency, we as humans sort of looking at it from the outside can just somehow see its consistency. Right? And the, you know, the rejoinder to that, you know, from the very beginning has been well, can we really e mean? Maybe, Maybe, Maybe, You know, maybe maybe he Penrose can, But, you know, can the rest of us, right? Uh, and, you know, I noticed that that, you know, I mean, it is perfectly plausible to imagine a computer that could say, you know, it would not be limited toe working within a single formal system, right? They could say, I am now going to adopt the hypothesis that this that my formal system is consistent, right? And I'm now going to see what can be done from that stronger vantage point and and so on. And you know what? I'm going to add new axioms to my system. totally plausible. There's absolutely girdle Serum has nothing to say about against an AI that could repeatedly add new axioms All. It says that there is no absolute guarantee that when the AI adds new axioms that it will always be right. Okay. And you know, and that's of course, the point that Penrose pounces on. But the reply is obvious. And, you know, it's one that that Alan Turing made 70 years ago name. We don't have an absolute guarantee that we're right when we add a new axiom we never have, and plausibly, we never will."},{"speaker":"spk_1","startTime":2788.68,"endTime":2792.01,"text":"So on Alan Turing, you took part in the love enterprise."},{"speaker":"spk_0","startTime":2792.38,"endTime":2805.35,"text":"Uh, not really.

Just early on in your life or in general have captivated you and just grabbed you."},{"speaker":"spk_0","startTime":3548.46,"endTime":3661.4,"text":"I think I'm gonna have to go with the idea of universality. Uh, you know, if you're really asking for the most beautiful I mean, uh, So universality is the idea that, you know, you put together a few simple operations, Like, in the case of bullying logic, that might be the end gate, the or gate, the not gate. Right. And then your first guess is okay, this is a good start, but obviously, as I want to do more complicated things, I'm going to need more complicated building blocks to express that. Right. And And that was actually my guess When I first learned what programming Waas. I mean, when I was, you know, an adolescent and I Someone showed me, uh, apple basic. And then, you know, G w basic, if any. Anyone listening remembers that. Okay, but, you know, I thought Okay, well, now you know, I mean, I mean, I thought I felt like, um, this is a revelation. You know, it's like finding out where babies come from. It's like that level of, you know, Why didn't anyone tell me this before? Right? But I thought Okay, this is just the beginning. Now I know how to write a basic program, but, you know, really write a an interesting program like a, you know, a video game which had always been my dream as a kid, you know, create my own Nintendo games, right? You know. But, you know, obviously I'm gonna need to learn some way more complicated form of programming than that. Okay. But, you know, eventually I learned this incredible idea of universality, and that says that no, you throw in a few rules and then you can You already have enough to express everything. Okay, So for example, the end, the or in the not gate, uh, can all or in fact even just the end of the not gate or even just even just the NAND gate, for example, eyes already enough to express any bullying function on any number of bits. You just have to string together Enough of"},{"speaker":"spk_1","startTime":3661.4,"endTime":3663.61,"text":"things you can build the university. You"},{"speaker":"spk_0","startTime":3663.61,"endTime":3790.09,"text":"could build the universe out of Nand gates. Yeah, you know, the the simple instructions of basic are already enough a T least in principle. You know, if we ignore details like how much memory can be accessed and stuff like that, that is enough to express what could be expressed by any programming language whatsoever. And the way to prove that is very simple. We simply need to show that in basic or whatever, we could write a an interpreter or compiler for whatever is other programming language we care about, Like C or Java or whatever. As soon as we have done that, then ipso facto anything that's express a ble and see your java is also express a ballin basic. Okay? And so this idea of universality, you know, goes back at least to Alan Turing in the 19 thirties when, you know, he, uh um wrote down this incredibly simple, pared down model of a computer. The touring machine, right, which, you know, he pared down the instruction set to just read a symbol, you know, go write a symbol, move to the left, move to the right hall, change your internal state. Right? That's it. Okay. And anybody proved that, you know, this could simulate all kinds of other things, you know. And so So in fact, today we would say, Well, we would call it a touring universal model of computation that is, you know, just as it has just the same expressive power that basic or Java or C plus plus or any of those other languages have, because anything in those other languages could be compiled down to touring machine. Now. Touring also proved a different related thing, which is that there is a single touring machine, uh, that can simulate any other touring machine. If you just describe that other machine on its tape right, and likewise, there is a single touring machine that will run any C program. You know, if you just put it on it's tape, that that's a second meaning"},{"speaker":"spk_1","startTime":3790.09,"endTime":3820.69,"text":"of universality. First of all, that he couldn't visualize it, And that was in the thirties thirties, before computers. Really? I mean, e don't know how I wonder what that felt like. Uh, you know, learning that there's no Santa Claus or something. Uh, because I don't know if that's empowering of paralyzing because it doesn't give you any.

But apparently girdle had had the same conjecture in the thirties on then. You know, you well, you know, and then and then and then and then tour and then girdle Red Turing's paper. And he kicked himself. And he said, Yeah, I was completely wrong about that. Okay? But But, you know, I had thought that maybe maybe where I can contribute will be to invent a new, more powerful programming language that lets you express things that could never be expressed in basic right And, you know, and you know, how would you do that? Obviously you couldn't do it itself in basic right, But, uh, but, you know, there is this incredible flattening that happens once you learn what is universality. But then it's also like a knopper to nitty because it means once you know these rules, then you know the sky is the limit. Right?

Um, you know, if if the numbers were twice as long, then it only it will take me twice as long to add them, but only twice as long, right?

I mean, even if you just If you just use the elementary school algorithm of just carrying, you know, then it it takes time that is linear in the length of the numbers. Right now, multiplication, if you use the elementary school algorithm, is harder because you have to multiply each digit of the first number by each digit of the second one. Yeah, and then deal with all the carries. So that's what we call a quadratic time algorithm. Right? If the numbers become twice as long now, you need four times as much time. Okay, so now, as it turns out, we, uh, people discovered much faster ways to multiply numbers using computers. And today we know how to multiply two numbers that are in digits, long using a number of steps That's nearly linear, innit? Thes air questions you can ask. But now let's think about a different thing that people, uh you know, ive encountered in elementary school of factoring a number. Okay, take a number and find its prime factors. Right? And here, you know, if I give you a number with 10 digits, I ask you for its prime factors. Well, maybe it's even So you know, that too is a factor. You know, maybe it ends in zero. So you know that 10 is a fact, All right. But, you know, other than a few obvious things like that, you know, if the prime factors air all very large, then it's not clear how you even get started, right? You know, you it seems like you have to do an exhaustive search among an enormous number of factors. Now, um and and as many people might know, uh, the for For better or worse, the security you know of most of the encryption that we currently used to protect the Internet is based on the belief, and this is not a the're, um It's a belief that that factoring is an inherently hard problem for our computers. We do know algorithms that are better. Then just try Aled division and just trying all the possible devise er's, but they're still basically exponential. Yeah, exactly. So that so the fastest algorithms that anyone has discovered, at least publicly discovered. You know, I'm assuming that the NSA doesn't know something better. Okay, but they take time that basically grows exponentially with the cube root of the size of the number that you're factoring, right? So that Q brew, that's the part that takes all the cleverness. Okay, but there's still an exponential. There's still an exponential ality there. But what that means is that, like when people use ah, 1000 bit keys for their cryptography, that can probably be broken using the resource is of the NSA or the world's other intelligence agencies. You know, people have done analyses that say, you know, with a few $100 million of computer power, they could totally do this. And if you look at the documents that Snowden released, you know, it looks it looks a lot like they are doing that or something like that. It would kind of be surprising if they weren't okay. But, you know, if that's true, then in in in some ways, that's reassuring. Because if that's the best that they could dio, then that would say that they can't break 2000 bet numbers, right?

I mean, you know, it was well developed even by the time that I was born. But, um, I in 2000 and two, I made a website called The Complexities, though toe, answer your question where I just try to catalog the different complexity classes, which are classes of problems that are solvable with different kinds of resource, is Okay, So these air kind of, um, you know, you could think of complexity classes as like being almost 222 theoretical computer science.

You could have just maybe you say, What are the If you take any kind of computer science class, what are the classes you learn?"},{"speaker":"spk_0","startTime":4292.65,"endTime":4518.08,"text":"Good. Let me let me tell you, sort of the the biggest ones, the ones that you would learn first. So, you know, first of all, there is P. That's what it's called. Okay? It stands for polynomial time. And this is just the class of all of the problems that you could solve with a conventional computer like your iPhone or your laptop, Uh, you know, by a completely deterministic algorithm, right? Using a number of steps that grows only, like the size of the input raised to some fixed power. Okay, so, uh, if your algorithm is linear time, like, you know, for adding numbers, okay, that that problem is in P. If you have an algorithm, that's quadratic time, like the elementary school algorithm for multiplying two numbers. That's also in P. Even if it was the size of the input to the 10th power or to the 50th power. Well, that wouldn't be very good and practice, but, you know, formally, we would still count that that would still be in p. Okay, But if your algorithm takes exponential time meaning like if every time I add one more data point to your input if the time that needed by the algorithm doubles if you need time like two to the power of the amount of input data then uh, that is it that we call an exponential time algorithm, okay? And that that is not polynomial. Okay, so P is all of the problems that have some polynomial time algorithm? Okay, So that includes most of what we do with our computers on a day to day basis. You know, all the, you know, sort sorting, basic arithmetic. You know, whatever is going on in your email reader or an angry birds, Okay, It's all it's all in p then the next super important class is called NP that stands for non deterministic polynomial. Okay, does not stand for not polynomial, which is ah, common confusion. But NP was basically all of the problems where if there is a solution, then it is easy to check the solution if someone shows it to you. Okay. So actually, a perfect example of a problem in N. P is factoring the one I told you about before. Like if I gave you a number with thousands of digits, and I told you that. You know, I I asked you. Does this? Does this have a least, um three nontrivial devise er's right. That might be a super hard problem to solve. It might take you millions of years using any algorithm that's known at least running on on our existing computers. Okay, but if I simply showed you the divisor I said, here are three divisor is of this number. Then it would be very easy for you to ask your computer to just check each one and see if it works. Just divided in, see if there's any remainder, right? And if they all go in, then you've checked. Well, I guess their work, right. So So any problem where you know, wherever there is a solution, there is a short witness that could be easily like a polynomial size witness that could be checked in polynomial time that we call an NP problem. Okay on. Uh, yes. So So every problem that's in P is also an MP. Right? Because, you know, you could always just ignore the witness and just you know if the problem isn't p, you could just solve it yourself. Okay, But now the in terms, that's the central, you know, mystery of theoretical computer science. Is every NP problem in pig? So if you can easily check the answer Thio Ah, computational problem. Does that mean that you can also easily find the answer?"},{"speaker":"spk_1","startTime":4518.09,"endTime":4527.19,"text":"Even though there's all these problems that appear, Thio be very difficult to find the answer.

I mean, in fact, you know, when people really pressed me on my blogged, for what odds would I put you know, two or 3% odds? That was pretty good. P equals np.

Okay, but, um so So, yeah, you know, I mean, there could certainly be surprises. And look, if P equals np well, then there would be the further question of, you know, is the algorithm actually efficient in practice, I mean, don canoes who? I know that you you've interviewed as well, right? He likes the conjecture that p equals np but that the algorithm is so inefficient that it doesn't matter anyway. Right now, I I don't know. I've listened to him say that I don't know whether he says that just because he has an actual reason for thinking it's true or just because it sounds cool. Okay. But, um but you know that that's a logical possibility, right? That the algorithm could be end to the 10,000 time, or or it could even just be end squared time, but with a leading constant of it could be a Google Times and squared or something like that. In that case, the fact that P equals NP well, it would. It would, uh, you know, ravage the whole theory of complexity. We would have to, you know, rebuild from the ground up, but in practical terms, it might mean very little, right? Uh, if the algorithm was too inefficient to run, if the algorithm could actually be run in practice, like if if it had small enough constants, you know you are. If you could improve it to where it had small enough constants that was efficient and practice, then that would change the world.

The question has been reduced to. Does that exist or not? If it does exist, then the answer would be, Yes, you can find it. Okay, if if you had this algorithm in your hands, Okay, you could ask your computer. You know, I mean, I mean, P versus NP is one of these seven problems that carries this million dollar prize from the clay foundation. You know, if you solve it, you know, and others air the Riemann hypothesis, the punk array, conjecture which was solved. Although the solver turned down the prize right. And and and and four others. But what I like to say the way that we can see that P versus NP is the biggest of all of these questions is that if you had this fast algorithm, then you could solve all seven of thumb. Okay? You just ask your computer, you know, is there a short proof of the Riemann hypothesis? Right? You know that that a machine could, in a language where a machine could verify it and provided that such a proof exists on your computer finds it in a short amount of time without having to do a brute force search.

You know, this is really only reared its head, I think a few times in the history of our field. Right. But, you know, it is it is theoretically possible that that such a thing could happen. But, you know, there are so even here there are some amusing observations that one could make. So there is this famous observation of Lien 11, who is, you know, one of the original discoverers of NP completeness, right? And he said Well, will consider the following algorithm that like I, I guarantee, will solve the NP problems efficiently, just as provided that p equals np. Okay, here is what it does. It just runs. You know it in numerator every possible algorithm in a gigantic, infinite list, right from like like alphabetical order, right? You know, and many of them maybe won't even compile. So we just ignore those. Okay, But now we just, you know, run the first algorithm. Then we run the second algorithm. We run the first one a little bit Mawr, then we run the first three algorithms for a while. We were in the first four for a while. This is called dovetailing, by the way. This is a known trick and theoretical computer science. Okay, but we do it in such a way that, you know, whatever is the algorithm out there in our list that solves np complete. You know, the NP problems efficiently will eventually hit that one, right. And now the key is that whenever we hit that one, you know, it was, you know, by assumption it has to solve the problem. Has to find a solution on once it claims to find a solution. Then we can check that ourself, right, Because they're these air problems. Then we could check it now. This is utterly impractical. Alright, You know, you'd have to do this enormous exhaustive search among all the algorithms. But from a certain theoretical standpoint, that is merely a constant pre factor, right? That's merely it's merely a multiplier of your running time. So there are tricks like that one could do to say that in some sense, the algorithm would have to be constructive. But you know, in in, in the in the human sense, you know, it is possible that you know it's conceivable that one could prove such a thing via a non constructive method. Is that likely?

Okay, but you know, I mean, there's there's what you could do with a randomized algorithm, right? That can sometimes, you know, with some has some probability of making a mistake That's called B p p. Bounded are probabilistic polynomial time on. Then of course, there's one that's very close to my own heart What you can efficiently dio doing polynomial time using a quantum computer.

That is an excellent question. Uh, so there there is. Um, well, I mean, what one has to prove that, Okay, But the proof, um, you could you could think of it as using Richard Feynman's picture of quantum mechanics, which is that you can always you know, we haven't really talked about quantum mechanics in this. In this conversation, we we did in our previous, but yeah, we did last time, okay, But but basically, you could always think of a quantum computation as like a branching tree of possibilities where each pot, each possible path that you could take through. You know, you're the space has a complex number attached to it, called an amplitude. Okay. And now the rule is you know, when you make a measurement at the end, when you see a random answer, Okay, but quantum mechanics is all about calculating the probability that you're going to see one potential answer versus another one, right? And the rule for calculating the probability that you'll see some answer is that you have to add up the amplitude for all of the paths that could have led to that answer. And then, you know, that's a complex number so that, you know, how could that be a probability? Then you take the squared absolute value of the result that gives you a number between zero and one. Okay, so I just I just summarized quantum mechanics and, like, 30 seconds, Okay, but But now you know what? What, what? What this already tells us is that anything I could do with a quantum computer I could simulate with a classical computer if I only have exponentially more time, okay. And why is that? Because if I have exponential time, I could just write down this entire branching tree and just explicitly calculate each of these amplitude, right? You know, that will be very inefficient, but it will work right? It's enough to show that quantum computers could not solve the halting problem. Or, you know, they could never do anything that is literally un compute a bubble in touring sense. Okay, But now, as I said, there is even a stronger result which says the B Q P is contained in peace space. The way that we prove that is that we say if if all I want is to calculate the probability of some particular output happening, you know, which is all I need to simulate a quantum computer, really? Then I don't need to write down the entire quantum state, which is an exponentially large object. All I need to dio is just calculate what is the amplitude for that final state. And to do that, I just have to sum up all the amplitude is that lead to that state. Okay, so that's an exponentially large sum. But I can calculate it, just reusing the same memory over and over for each term in the song. Yeah, yeah."},{"speaker":"spk_1","startTime":5439.58,"endTime":5453.76,"text":"So what out of that whole complexity zoo. It could. B B Q P. What do you find is the most, uh, the class that captured your heart the most was the most beautiful classes just I"},{"speaker":"spk_0","startTime":5453.77,"endTime":5747.66,"text":"I I used as my email address. B. Q. P. Q. Polly at gmail dot com. Just because b q p slash q Polly. Well, you know, amazingly, no one had taken it Amazing. But, you know, But this is a class that I was involved in, sort of defining, proving the first dirhams about in 2003 or so. So it was kind of close to my heart. But this is like if we extended b q p, which is the class of everything we can do efficiently with a quantum computer, uh, to allow quantum advice, which means imagine that you had some special initial state okay, that could somehow help you do computation. And maybe, um, such a state would be exponentially hard to prepare. Okay. But, you know, maybe somehow these states were formed in the Big Bang or something, and they've just been sitting around ever since, Right, if you found one, and if this state could be like ultra power. There are no limits on how powerful it could be, except that this state doesn't know in advance which input you've got right. It only knows the size of your input, you know, And then that that that's B Q P slash Q. Probably. So that's that's one that I just personally happened toe love. Okay, But, um, you know, if you're asking me what's the you know, there's a There's a class that I think is way more beautiful than you know, our fundamental than a lot of people. Even within this, this field realized that it is that class is called SCK or statistical zero knowledge. Um, and you know, there's a very, very easy way to define this class, which is to say, suppose that I have to algorithms that each sample from probability distributions, right? So each one's outputs random samples, according Thio, you know, possibly different distributions. And now the question I asked is, you know, you know, let's say distributions over strings of end bits, you know, So over an exponentially large space. Now I ask, Are these two distributions close or far as probability distributions? Okay, any problem that could be reduced to that, you know, that could be put into that form is an sdk problem. And the way that this class was originally discovered was completely different from that and was kind of more complicated. It was discovered as the class of all of the problems that have a certain kind of what's called zero knowledge proof, the zero knowledge proofs or one of the central ideas in cryptography. Um, you know, Shafi Goldwasser and Sylvia Macaulay won the touring award for, you know, inventing them. And they're at the core of even some some crypto currencies that you know, people people use nowadays. But there are zero knowledge proofs. They're ways of proving to someone that something is true. Like, you know, that there is ah ah solution to this, you know, optimization problem. Or that these two graphs are isom horrific to each other or something, but without revealing why it's true without revealing anything about why it's true. Okay, SCK is all of the problems for which there is such a proof that doesn't rely on any cryptography. Okay? And if if you wonder, like, how could such a thing possibly exist, right? Well, like imagine that I had two graphs and I wanted to convince you that these two graphs are not Isom or FIC. Meaning, you know, I cannot per mute one of them so that it's the same as the other one. Right? You know, that might be a very hard statement to prove like I might need, you know, you might have to do a very exhaustive and you Marais Shin of, you know, all the different permutations. Before you were convinced that it was true. But what if there were some all knowing wizard, that said to you? Look, I'll tell you what, Just pick one of the graphs randomly, then randomly per mute it, then send it to me. And I will tell you which graph you started with Guy. And I will do that every single time, right? Yeah. And and and And let's say that that wizard did that 100 times and it was right every time. Right now, if the graphs were Isom or FIC, then you know it would have been flipping a coin each time, right? It would have had it only a one and two to the 100 power chance of you know of guessing right each time. But you know so So if if it's right every time, then now you're statistically convinced that these graphs air not Isom or FIC, even though you've learned nothing new about why they are eso. So sdk is all of the problems that have protocols like that one. But it has this beautiful other characterization. It's shown up again and again in my in my own work and, you know, a lot of people's work. And I think that it really is one of the most fundamental classes. It's just that people didn't realize that when it was first discovered."},{"speaker":"spk_1","startTime":5748.64,"endTime":5763.76,"text":"So we're living in the middle of a pandemic.
